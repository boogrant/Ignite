        <h2>About Ignite</h2>
        <p>When I moved from Scotland to New Zealand at 16, I found myself searching for a youth group that could truly feed my soul. Back home, I had been part of a strong youth community where we focused on putting God at the center of everything we did—while also having fun and building lasting friendships. But in New Zealand, it was different. Many youth groups didn’t prioritize God in the way I was used to. Some felt more like a community center than a place to grow in faith, and others simply didn’t align with my evangelical Christian beliefs.

        That’s when the idea for Ignite was born. I wanted to create a space where young people could find the resources, support, and community they need to grow in their faith while still having fun. A space that honors God at the center, offers modern worship music that speaks to today’s generation, and creates lasting friendships through a shared love for Christ.

        Through Ignite, I want to share what I’ve learned and the resources that have helped me in my walk with God. Music that has uplifted me, Bible studies that have grounded me, and sermons that have inspired me. My hope is to connect youth who feel alone or disconnected from a faith community, offering them a place where they can find support, encouragement, and connection to others who share the same passion for God.

        Ignite is not just a platform—it’s a movement. A movement to close the gap, not just between different youth groups, but across the world. To spread God’s Word, to build a community of believers, and to show youth that they don’t have to feel alone in their faith journey.</p>
