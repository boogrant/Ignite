            <h2>About Ignite</h2>
            <p>When I moved from Scotland to New Zealand at 16, I struggled to find a youth group that truly focused on God. In Scotland, I was part of a community that put God at the center of everything—while also having fun and building lasting friendships. But in New Zealand, I found that many youth groups lacked this focus and didn’t align with my evangelical Christian beliefs.</p>

            <p>That’s when the idea for Ignite was born. I wanted to create a space where young people could grow in their faith, have fun, and build lasting relationships centered around God. A place that offers modern worship music, practical resources, and a vibrant community of believers.</p>

            <p>Through Ignite, I aim to share the resources and experiences that have helped me grow spiritually—music that has uplifted me, Bible studies that have grounded me, and sermons that have inspired me. I want to connect youth who may feel disconnected from a faith community, offering them a place of encouragement, support, and connection with others who share their passion for Christ.</p>

            <p>Ignite is more than just a platform; it’s a movement to bridge the gap across the world, spread God’s Word, and create lasting relationships. You don’t have to feel alone in your faith journey anymore.</p>
